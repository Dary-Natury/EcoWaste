# EcoWaste
## Aim
The aim of the project is to develop a technology for the management of by-products or waste from herbal production. 

## Description
A large amount of waste is generated at the plant during production. Most of it is recycled or composted. Much of this waste has the potential to contain substances that can be used in other processes or for new products. So far, they have not been used in further industrial production, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the chemical composition and biological effect, and due to the lack of technology for their further processing. The specific objective of the project is to generate knowledge and implement it in the form of developing a technological process and producing a product with known and tested biological properties.
